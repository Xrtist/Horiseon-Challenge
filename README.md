# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

I went in and cleaned up all of the code in the HTML and CSS files.

In the HTML file, I added "alt" elements to the images files that required one for accessability purposes. 

I also labeled all the divs into "header", "section", etc to make it more readable.

I cleaned up the writing and structure of the HTML file since there were also typos along with spacing errors.

In the CSS file, I replaced the color #ffffff with a root property throughout the CSS file.
